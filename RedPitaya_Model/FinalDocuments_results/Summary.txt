Based on the evaluation metrics for the testing data, here are the results:

Evaluation Metrics - Person Sitting:

Accuracy: 0.9742
Precision: 1.0
Recall: 0.9742
F1 Score: 0.9869

Evaluation Metrics - Empty Chair:

Accuracy: 0.9991
Precision: 0.0
Recall: 0.0
F1 Score: 0.0


For the "Person Sitting" category, the model achieved a high accuracy of 0.9742, indicating that it correctly classified 97.42% of instances. 
The precision is 1.0, meaning that all instances classified as "Person Sitting" were indeed correct. 
The recall is also high at 0.9742, indicating that the model captured 97.42% of the actual "Person Sitting" instances. 
The F1 score combines precision and recall, and in this case, it is 0.9869, which is a good overall measure of the model's performance for the "Person Sitting" category.







However, for the "Empty Chair" category, the results are different. 
The accuracy is very high at 0.9991, indicating that the model correctly classified 99.91% of instances. 
However, the precision, recall, and F1 score are all 0.0, suggesting that the model did not correctly identify any instances of the "Empty Chair" category. 
This could be due to a lack of positive examples in the training data for the "Empty Chair" category, leading to the model not learning how to distinguish it effectively.



In summary, the model performs well for the "Person Sitting" category, but it struggles with the "Empty Chair" category. 
It is important to ensure a balanced and representative training dataset to improve the model's performance for both categories.
