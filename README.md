### Reliability Test and Improvement of a Sensor System for Person Detection in a Smart Office Automation
Abstract:
Enhancing smart office automation by accurately detecting human presence using Red Pitaya's Ultrasonic sensor system. This research employs supervised machine learning with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to achieve remarkable classification accuracy. Two methodologies, including a stand-alone Ultrasonic sensor model and an integrated sensor-camera model, yield nearly identical results, addressing privacy concerns. This study showcases the potential of non-intrusive sensor-based person recognition for enhanced office efficiency and convenience in smart environments.
